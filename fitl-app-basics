        <h1>Richmond Dark Lager</h1>

        <p>Richmond Dark Lager is an extension of our classic American Craft Lager, you know as
             Richmond Lager. Using a touch of highly kilned drum roasted, dehusked malt in the recipe, 
             we transform our pale yellow Richmond Laget to a translucent mahogany color with notes of delicate roast, 
             chocolate, and caramel flavors and aromas. 
             Fuller in body than our classic Richmond Lager, 
             Richmond Dark Lager retains the clean and crisp finish you look for in a well-crafted lager.
